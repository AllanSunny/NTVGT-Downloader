## About the Project
This program was made in order to streamline the process of downloading game audio clips from Youtube, trimming them down to short segments, and organizing the resulting files. 

Doing this tedious process previously took multiple hours for sessions containing upwards of 3 rounds with 30 songs each. The NTVGT Downloader shaved this time down to less than an hour!

This project was created using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v12.13.1. Currently, it is only designed for use on Windows devices.
